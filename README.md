# Flask REST API Tutorial

This is a collection of the extracurricular tutorials taught by myself at Korea University about how to get started with creating REST API's using Flask. These tutorials will also go over using Python in a production environment.

**Coverage**
- Implementing REST API using Flask-Restful
- Using Docker for development and production
- Authentication


## Getting Started

You can get started by cloning the repository on your desktop. The code should be commented enough to follow along and understand.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3.7 and Docker installed.

### Final Notes

I'm always happy to help out and teach others. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me!
